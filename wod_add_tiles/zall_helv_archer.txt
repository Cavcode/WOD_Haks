Archer Towers by Helvene

Three small haks containing several archer towers for three tilesets:
# stand-alone tower and wall towers for both walls and wall corners for Rural
# stand-alone tower and wall towers for both walls and wall corners for Winter Rural
# stand-alone tower, wall tower and wall corner tower for Forest

I've tested it on HoU v.167, but it should not require any files from HoU
expansion, so, all three haks should work on SoU-1.67 as well.
