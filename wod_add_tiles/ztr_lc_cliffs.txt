Rural Tree Cliffs by Lucifer Church

This is a rather unspectacular modification of the rural tileset :) It allows
you to place forest directly adjacent to a cliff. I got frustrated at using
walls as 'natural' blockade to keep players from certain areas, so I created
these tiles. If you want to see more tileset work visit the german High Forest
Alliance (www.neverwinternights.de) once we are online. If you want to
transfer these tiles to an already modified rural tileset: - copy tile 249 -
259 from the set file of the hak pack to your new set file - increase the tile
count by eleven - modify primary rule 25 so tiles adjacent to forest on level
1 do not get raised.

This is now version 1.1. CHANGES: - Turned z18 model - Added the edge.2da so
that the correct edges will be shown - Modified the path modifiers on the set
entries
