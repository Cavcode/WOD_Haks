Usable Beds v2.1 by Brolanda
http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&id=3210


Usable Beds!
Dead tired from all your adventures?
Sleep on a nice cozy bed!
This hakpak modifies the default tiles that have beds,
making all of them usable.

v2.1 Update: Fixed left side of Bordello bed, thank you Aeryn-!
Walking around on the beds, found and fixed the headboards that you could walk in to;
And the three castle bed footboards that you could walk through.

v2.0 Update: Fixed the beds with the big fluffy pillows and
the bunkbed tiles are done.
I ran into walkmesh issues with the bunkbeds;
the bottom bunks work fine, the top bunks do not work for characters.
However, the top bunks work great with hmmm83's Sleeping Placeables.


NOTE: For Toolset Play, see the NOTE ON BUNKBEDS... towards the bottom of this README.
  

Module Play:
        To try it out, there is a "tiny" mod.
        Put the hak file "UsableBeds.hak" in your hak directory.
        Put the mod file "UsableBeds.mod" in your modules directory.
        And start NWN.
        Use "A Bed" on the left side of the bed,
                near the head of the bed (to the north).


Toolset Play:
        Put the hak file "UsableBeds.hak" in your hak directory.
        Put the mod file "UsableBeds.mod" in your mod directory.
                Note: The mod file is not necessary,
                        but it does show how I get it to work.
        Basically,
                The hakpak modifies and replaces all the default tiles that have beds.
                The only thing modified is the walkmeshes involving the beds,
                  (and the pillows on 5 of the beds that were too fluffy for the sleepers).

        Choose "Castle Interior" or "City Interior" for the Area.
        In "Module Properties" choose the Hak File "UsableBeds"
        Then use the Paint Terrain Feature to paint a tile with a bed.
        Put a waypoint "on" the bed, near the head of the bed,
                pointing to the head of the bed.
        Put one or more "invisible objects", found in Placeable Miscellaneous, on the bed.
        Make the "invisible object" Usable and edit its OnUsed script to something like:

void main()
{
   object oPC;
   object oBED;
   oPC = GetLastUsedBy();
   oBED = GetNearestObjectByTag("WP_BED");

   AssignCommand(oPC, JumpToLocation(GetLocation(oBED)));
   AssignCommand(oPC, ActionDoCommand(SetFacing(GetFacing(oBED))));
   AssignCommand(oPC, ActionPlayAnimation(ANIMATION_LOOPING_DEAD_FRONT, 1.0f, 10.0f));
}

        And that's it.

        Note: If you use the above script, you should be able to
                use the same script for all beds if you tag all the bed waypoints
                as "WP_BED".

NOTES ON BUNKBEDS AND BORDELLO:
        BUNKBEDS - The dual walkmesh to get the bunkbeds to work,
                gives an effect like stacking placeable crates, but in reverse.
                You need to select the object being placed on the bottom bunk and
                place it correctly the first time (or delete it and try again).
                Moving it after letting go of it will move it up to the top bunk.
                Like the crates, you can select the object from the left side-bar and
                rotate it with the rotation controls on the bottom-bar
                and you can change its properties.
        BORDELLO - A character sleeping in the bordello still buries their face in the pillow.
                From what I can tell Sleeping Characters lay horizontally regardless of the walkmesh,
                and I did not come up with a solution to this pillow, except to get rid of it,
                but I did not have the heart to, so I didn't. :)
                If you want to get rid of it, and you know about 3d model 'nodes',
                    the model for the bordello is 'tin01_s15_01.mdl' in the hakpak,
                    the pillow is the node Cylinder50, and this node can just be deleted in a text editor,
                    and it will work (I have done it with no problems).



Lots of people to thank!
