Stone Room Bath by Sarchasm

The hakpack adds a duplicate of Stone Room 2 to the Castle Interior tileset
that shows up in the Groups section as "Bath." It's similar to the bath in the
Rich terrain, but offers a bit more privacy.

It's just something I had laying around so feel free to use it, combine it, or
simply ignore it.
