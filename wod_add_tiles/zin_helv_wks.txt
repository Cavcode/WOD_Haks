Workshop Tileset by Helvene
http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&id=6556


The title speaks for itself. Someone may find it this tileset useful for
creating a large workshop or smithy. Or, maybe, a crafting area for a PW. The
hak contains the tileset itself and two new doors made especially for it.
See screenshots for more info.

I've put a test module and some screenshots into the archive along with the
hak.

This is the first version of the hak. Maybe, one day I'm going to add more
groups and features to the tileset, a fence and some placeables.

Please, let me know if you find any bugs (and if you have any ideas about
making it better).

Update v1.1: fixed the problem with loadscreens.

Update v1.2: added several tiles, fixed some walkmesh problems.
