Diagonal Walls by Stephen Nispel

This is an update for my diagonal walls hak for the standard crypt tileset.
This hak fixes previous 'sparkle' issues, and now includes 10 tiles, including
floor and pit wall combinations! All tiles will fit and rotate automatically
as you paint or change tiles. This hak will not break any areas created with
the default Crypt tileset or with a previous version of this hak. I have also
included a small demo module.
