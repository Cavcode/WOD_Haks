CEP Tileset Pack - CEP 2.2


NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The hak is completely self-contained. Some tilesets had tiles, doors, load
  screens, or other features removed to avoid conflicts with CTP or other haks.
  A full list of tiles and tilesets included can be found at the end of this
  document. Where it could be found, documentation for each tileset has also
  been included in the cep2_add_tiles1.hak and cep2_add_doors.hak files. To
  view the included documentation, open the haks in NWN Explorer and browse to
  'Information Files'.
  
  All resources have been renamed to avoid any conflicts. Padding has been
  added before all custom tiles in each SET file. CEP tiles are all in the
  range 500-1999.
  
  Due to tileset merging, you may find unexpected terrain showing up in the
  toolset. An example of this is you may see Desert or Organic walls showing
  up at Water/Wall interfaces in the Mines tileset. This was done to keep the
  number of terrain types low and to allow various terrain types to be used
  together on the same map.
  
  Normally, the solution would be to use the Eraser tool repeatedly, but this
  can be aggravating as it changes tiles randomly. Instead, after you paint
  terrain, press the Escape key so you are no longer painting terrain, and
  then hold down Shift while right-clicking on the individual tile you wish to
  change. This will flip through all eligible tiles in sequence, without
  randomness. In addition, this works perfectly with crossers, while Eraser
  does not.

  A huge credit must be given to OldMansBeard for his CleanModels tool. All
  tileset models were run through it, in addition to many being cleaned up
  by hand.

HAKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The CEP tileset pack is distributed as several haks:
    cep2_add_tiles*.hak
      These provide separately named extended versions of several Bioware
      tilesets. These will be prefixed in your tileset list with [CEP] and
      will be found at the end of the list. Using this hak will not affect any
      Bioware tileset or any other tileset hak.
  
    cep2_add_doors.hak
      This provides a collection of generic doors. It is optional and may be
      used on its own or with the CEP tilesets. It is not required to use the
      CEP tilesets.
  
    cep2_ext_tiles.hak
      This overrides the Bioware tilesets, extending them with the CEP
      enhancements. Adding this hak to your module will add all the extensions
      from the CEP tilesets to the base Bioware tilesets. You will see the
      tileset names followed by an * in the tileset list when this hak is
      active. This hak must be used in conjunction with all cep2_add_tiles haks.
  
      Using this hak is optional; if you add the cep2_add_tiles haks to your
      module but do not use cep2_ext_tiles, you will still have access to all
      CEP tileset enhancements using the [CEP] tilesets.


DOORS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  All tileset-specific doors have been added as generic doors. Although they
  may not fit in a generic door doorway, they can be moved after they are
  placed using the Adjust Location tool. This allows some interesting building
  opportunities using them in conjunction with placeables, or even by
  themselves (for example, the Drow Dome Door).
