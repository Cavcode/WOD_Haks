These are extended waterfalls for the rural tileset. The hak will enable you
to build waterfalls that extend over several tiles.

How to build: Raise a plateau and create water on that plateau (you need at
least a 3 x 3 plateau for that). Then place water at the base of the plateau.
After that you will be able to place water right at the edge of the plateau,
connecting the sea on top of the plateau with the water at its base, forming a
waterfall.
