Underdark Ruins by Helvene

This hak adds a ruined wall crosser and several ruied buildings to Bioware Underdark tileset.

All the credits for original models go to the authors of Ruins and RuralRuins
tilesets. I only retextured them, fixed the walkmeshes, made all of the roofs
walkable and slightly modified the models to remove several broken parts and
give them an appropriate ground height to fit the Underdark tileset.

Known Issues:
# minimaps for new models vary slightly from others used for Underdark;
# weird shadows are possible for several tiles.
