One more tileset for elves, mainly - for wood elves.

Important! If you want beaming effect for tiles with big trees to work, you
are supposed to set your area to "Exterior", and it's lighting settings to
"Always Bright". Basic enviroment settings for the tileset do not support
this.

Important! Doorway crosser works firstly for corridor, but allows placing
doors in many positions for each crosser tile.

Update 1.1
  # fixed a problem with several groups and features not showing up properly in toolset
  # added corner tiles for Platform terrain
  # added couches for Floor and Platform Terrain
  # added two one-tile bedrooms (Round Room w.Couch in toolset)
  # added another Spiral Stair, leading both up and down
  # added more options for corridors (Doorway crosser)

A note on update. At first, all original haks you download from now, already
contain the tiles from add-on haks. At second, if you're already using the
hak, and want to switch to a newer version, you can simply download an
add-on hak and add it above the original in a hak list.


Update 1.2
# Fixed the problem with "Grass Room" being placed instead of "Window with Wall (grass)".

Please, make sure that you have the latest hak version before adding the
files from the fix into it.
