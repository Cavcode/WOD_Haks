Gentle Hills by Wayland

Wayland made a wonderful Gentle hills hak addon to the rural tileset. This
addon was never updated to HOTU for folks to use. Mermut patiently guided me
through a direct update to produce this new Hak/addon that is fully updated to
HOTU. I would like to thank Wayland for producing such a fine hak and Mermut
for teaching me how to update the .set and .itp files.

Anyone can use this hak for their mods and pws it was made for the Harvest
Moon persistant world. There is no other custom content other than the
gentlehills themselves.

We've added a new hak Anius and I worked together with Mermut advising to
create a gentle hills for the rural winter tileset. The Two haks combined can
be a great edition to any single mod or pw.

The original Waylands gentle hills is found here

After a long time Ive finally updated the haks and combined them.
Wayland_Harvest along with Winter hills and Xanas'es Desertdunes are now
combined into one hak called Harvest Hills. Theres alot of people to thank for
this hak. First off the two originators Wayland and Veldin for their hills.
Xanas for his conversion of Veldins hak to an addon instead of a seperate
tileset. And finally to my team Mermut and Anius who worked on the update to
waylands gentle hills hak then the creation of Winterhills. Thanks everyone
for your contributions

updated the doors 2da in harvest hills to be 1.69 compatable
