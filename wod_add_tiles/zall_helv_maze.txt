Maze Tileset by Helvene

This was supposed to be a maze tileset.

I'm releasing it when it's still far from what I've planned to make, but if I
wait until I have enough time to finish what I've started, it's highly
possible that the hak will never see the light of the day.

The whole tileset is made with crossers, such as corridor, .orridor with lava
stream and corridor with water stream. Only the simple corridor terrain is
close to it's final state for now, all others have only several tiles for
each. The tileset contains minimaps for all tiles and two loadscreens.

Maybe someone decides to finish it. Maybe, a little later I will find time to
complete the work. Right now, it's submitted "as is", though I've done several
tests to be sure that it's a workable hak, it's possible to make playable
areas with it and it doesn't crash the toolset :P

My greatest thanks to gaoneng for his flowing river. I'm using this idea in
water streams for this tileset, and it proved to be wonderful.

Update: added doorways; fixed missing mainlights; no minimap hak uploaded
