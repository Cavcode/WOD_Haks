Hi there Everyone, welcome to the Desert w/Dunes tilset.

This is an addition to the official Bioware Desert tileset. It combines
ThallionStellani's Hills and Homes with the Bioware SoU Desert tileset. I have
also added a few tiles from the rural tileset as well. You can now create
rolling deserts with dunes, hills and other features.  

This tilset comes with only 2 textures as all the other textures are already
part of NWN. You will need SoU and the tileset is compatable with the 1.61
patch. This uses all the tiles from the desert tileset and adds the extras so
only the extras are included in this zip.

To use this just associate the hak with your module and then build a new area.
You will see a new tileset showing up called Desert w/Dunes. Then build away!
To get dunes, raise an area with the raise/lower tool and then use the "Dunes"
crosser in the same area to drag over them turning the hills into dunes.

I have a small oasis tile I am working on at the moment but it has some issues
so is not ready to be added in yet. When it is ready all you will need to do
is add the new set file, itp file and the tiles to your current TTR02.hak file
for the new tile to show up.

What this Includes:

  Raise/Lower added to the Desert tileset.
  Dunes Crosser.
  New 1x1 dune tile that randomly paints down.
  ThallionStellani's Hills and Homes retextured and converted for Desert.
  Menhir retextured and added to Desert
  Crystal retextured and added to Desert
  Cave Mouth retextured and added to Desert (Called Small Cave)

Known Issues:

  For some reason if you raise the terrain over a second level people can walk
  up the sides of the second+ hills. If someone knows a fix let me know and
  I'll add it in.
