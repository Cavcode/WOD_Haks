LOK Tileset # 7:

Additional tiles for the Castle Interior tileset.
This tileset overrides the OC tileset but should
not affect any area that you've created using the
official tileset in any way although you will be
able to go back and modify existing areas using
the new tiles.

This tileset addon is comprised of Yellowlabs's 12
round corner and stair tiles that he added to the
OC tileset although I modified them slightly for
door node placement.

In addition there are about 16 to 20 more tiles
that I added. These were done in about an hour so
I can't guarentee these are working perfectly.

So you get about 30 tiles more give or take a few.

The majority of the tiles I added were simple
cleanup of the existing OC tiles, especially in
the library to get rid of the clutter.  But all
terrain types got a tile or two at least with
the exception of the 'Jail' tiles which I don't
as of yet have a need for in my modules so I 
didn't do any.  ;)

Yellowlab's original credits:

This hak pak adds 12 tiles to the castle tileset
 to allow for round rooms in castles.  Tiles i
nclude standard, empty, stairs up and stairs down
 for each of the three main floor types 
(rich, library, stone).  Thanks to Danmar 
and Velmar for help with the walkmeshes.

Use and enjoy, but please give credit where 
credit is due.
