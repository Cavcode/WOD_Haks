LOK Tileset Addon - Rural To Forest Transition
--------------------------------------------

Pretty simple really.  Adds a small handful of tiles and the appropriate
changes to the rural tileset data files to allow you to transition into a
Forest area properly.

Although properly may not be the right word.  :)

Only a very limited selection of forest tiles is available in this hak.
Essentially you can place some trees and use a road to cross between the two
terrains as well.

That's it.  For a full scale forest set you can just transition into the
forest.

After all its just for transitions between rural and forest areas, not a large
combo tileset.

Contents:

9 custom tiles for the transitions 1 custom texture for the transitions
modified .set and itp file to add the base 4xforest tiles, the base
4xforest+road tiles, and the transition tiles as Forest terrain.  modified
edge.2da file for basic edge tiling.


Some caveats:

The transitions do NOT match up with anything other Grass.  No trees, streams,
walls, etc and so on. 

Yes the road tile that cross from Grass into Forest has to look like that.  The
grass and forest roads use a different texture and that was the quickest
solution and least hak heavy to blend the crossover.

THe dark smudge you'll see at times where my transition tiles meet up with the
forest tiles is an artifact of the OC forest floor texture.  You can see this
smudge line all over the OC tiles as well and since I'm using the OC texture
obviously it carries through to my tiles.

The corner piece tiles are left empty on purpose.  If you want to spruce them
up use placeables.

This is being released AS IS!

Feel free to create a mondo true Rural Forest combo using these transition
tiles if you wish, just include my name in the credits.
