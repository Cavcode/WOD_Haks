Castle Interior Expanded by Tiggs
http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&id=7501


This is a combination of several additions to Bioware's default Castle Interior Tileset, all available on the Vault in separate haks.


<< HOW TO USE >>

* Put the hak file in your hak folder.
* Open your module in the toolset. Choose Edit -> Module Properties -> Custom Content.
* Choose "castle_expanded" in the dropdown list. Click Add and OK.
* Wait for the module to be built or hit Cancel (it won't ruin anything).
* Create a new area and pick the usual Castle Interior tileset. That's it. :)

Adding this hak will not ruin any areas that you have created previously using the Castle Interior tileset.

* Stone Room Bath, by Sarchasm

Bath #2 is the original from the hak. Bath #1, with the door on the short end of the room, is made by me (I can't create new tiles, but I'm a devil when it comes to manipulating existing stuff).

Finally, the hak was created with the help of Labtek's excellent NWN Tileset Duplicator (http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&id=338).

Many thanks to all the authors above who made this hak possible. :)
