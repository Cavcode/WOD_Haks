Windows for Castle Interior by Stephen Nispel
http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Hakpaks.Detail&id=4909


This hakpak is an add-on for the default Castle Interior tileset. This hak
contains new tiles that allow you to add various windows to your areas, making
them more like the interior of an actual building. It includes windows for the
Stone, Rich, Library, and Corridor tiles. Using this hak will not break any
areas already created with the standard Bioware Castle Interior tileset, or
with previous versions of this hak. Future releases may include more window
styles to add to the variety, depending on the number of requests. Includes a
demo module for the hakpak.

Recent changes:
  v1.2 - Improved shadows and texture mapping on models, reducing overall
    filesize by 10%
  v1.1b - Corrected walkmesh/pathing errors in a few corridor tiles
  v1.1 - Corrected crash issue when loading Demo, and added tiles to allow
    windows in corridors
